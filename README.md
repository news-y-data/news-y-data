"News Y Data" is a website designed to be a platform for news primarily supported by robust data from reliable sources and its critical analysis.

In the age of information, not only scientists and academicians, but even ordinary people have access to various data, which can be obtained either 
by individual research or from reliable organizations. As the internet became more accessible, a great deal of fake news is being spewed across social media 
by political, governmental, and private institutions to advance their selfish agendas. Only a few fact-checking sites such as [AltNews](https://news-y-data.github.io/) and
[Associated Press](https://apnews.com/hub/ap-fact-check) exist to sift through plenty of fake posts published every minute.

News Y Data is trying to bridge this gap by allowing individuals to post meaningful insights derived from authentic data. Inspired by the principles of 
software development, all posts will be reviewed thoroughly by peers (moderators) to ensure quality. Posts are expected to be substantiated by data, 
preferably in the format of tables and graphs so that everybody can understand.  

The project is currently looking for new ideas to improve the process and for content creators and moderators.
